# Thesis Project
This repository is a working repository of the code I write to clean data and conduct data analysis on the supply-side of the oil and gas industry. The goal of the project is to analyze the effects of oil shocks on local and state GDP and ultimately estimate the overall effect on US GDP, which will be relevant as the US becomes an oil-producing nation. I will be analyzing state-based employment, wage, and hours worked; oil-well permits; oils futures; and other relevant economic variables on a state by state level. There will also be regression analysis conducted.

Hopefully I will develop packages that may be of use to others doing research on the energy industry, or those people that wish to use federal data (which can be quite clunky to clean). 

I will edit the README as different branches are developed for this project for the ease of anyone who wishes to follow along or pull from this repository. 

# Motivation
I am a student at the University of Michigan working on my Honors Thesis in Economics. I am currently working with Dr. Matthew D. Shapiro to begin this project. I hope to conduct meaningful analysis that will contribute both to the oil and gas industry as well as to Economic research more broadly. I would like to write a paper that will be published in a reputable journal of Economics. This code will be open source for repeatablility and further analysis, should anyone wish to do so. 

# Code type 
I will be using RStudio to conduct this analysis. Packages used will be detailed here.
